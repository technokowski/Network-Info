## Network-Info
# Simple menu bar utility to display network info to the user

**This is Mac OSX/macOS only.

This app sits in the menu bar and gives info about the computer to the user;
Logged in user, Computer Name, (If applicable: Wifi IP, BSSID, ethernet IP)

It's written in bash, and compiled using Platypus. 

Very lightweight, and only runs when clicked on the menu bar.
